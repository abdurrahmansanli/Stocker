# Stocker

Stocker is a sample iOS app project I made for a job application.

I've spent 1 day of work for the project.

Featuring:
- Access to stock prices.
- Search by stock symbol name.
- Detail screens including a line graph.
- An example to common iOS concepts including tableviews, scrollviews, autolayout, usage of soap services with afnetworking etc.

This repository was made for http://www.veripark.com and landed me a job at both http://www.veripark.com and http://www.mobilist.com.tr . While they both came with solid offers, I chose http://www.mobilist.com.tr because they were first to call.
