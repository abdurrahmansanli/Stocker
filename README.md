# Stocker

Stocker is a sample iOS app project I made in 2014.

I've spent 1 day of work for the project.

Featuring:
- Access to stock prices.
- Search by stock symbol name.
- Detail screens including a line graph.
- An example to common iOS concepts including tableviews, scrollviews, autolayout, usage of soap services with afnetworking etc.
